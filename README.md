# smart-grid-simulation
A simulation of a Dynamic Pricing to encourage clean energy consumption trought the smart meters in the future smart grid!

Also we simulate a network communication ot obtain the total delay to calculate the price.

This network could be attacked to change the energy price in order to obtain advantages or to injure someone.

So we also simaulte a DoS attack (maybe in the PHY, MAC, NET ou upper layers) in the PRIME, 6LoWPAN or LTE-a technologies just omitting the meter measures to arrive in the price center.

After, we used a mensal history mean of the meter and data concentrator measures to estimate the mean variation of the energy price, generation curves and the clean energy encouragement.

Enjoy :)
